# Arduino-Menu-System

## This project is currently in development.

This is my menu system that is used for personal Arduino projects. Currently used on the Aruino Nano Every so it uses direct port manipulation for that board and will most likely not be compatible with most other board types.
This will be used in the future on other boards and new features and compatibility will be added.
